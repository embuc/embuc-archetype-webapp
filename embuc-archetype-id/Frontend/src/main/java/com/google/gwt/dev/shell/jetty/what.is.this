Q: Why is JettyLauncher.java included in the project?
A: It's an ugly workaround to get the project running in development mode together with Spring and Hibernate.

See: http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=5693 for details.
Below is an excerpt from the website.

GWT Development Mode requires all JARs to be placed in WEB-INF/lib.
It's especially painful when programmers use m2eclipse, which provides its own Eclipse classpath container.

GWT version used: 2.0.4 (I guess that this issue is relevant in others as well)
Operating systems: Windows, Linux; I guess that probably all

This issue may be a duplicate of issue 5033, but I'm not sure, so I've made this one.

Workaround for this issue we applied in our project:
1) find source code of JettyContainer.java - it's already in gwt-dev.jar added by Eclipse GWT plugin to classpath
2) copy the source of this class to your project's classpath to the same package (com.google.gwt.dev.shell.jetty)
3) Open this copied Java file, find lines:

    public WebAppClassLoaderExtension() throws IOException {
        super(bootStrapOnlyClassLoader, WebAppContextWithReload.this);

And below them add this:

        URLClassLoader loader = (URLClassLoader) Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
        for(URL url : loader.getURLs()) {
        	addURL(url);
        }

Works, but it's only a workaround (quite ugly workaround). A better solution to this problem would be good.
